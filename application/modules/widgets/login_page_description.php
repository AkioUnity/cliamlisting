                    At JustMy we believe that Doing Good should be at the core of everything we do, this is why in every market we serve, we offer support and promotional services for LOCAL non-profits.  As you help create amazing content to promote the city, we use that traffic to promote and support LOCAL causes.<br><br>

                    We help tackle issues like Cancer in our support of the American Cancer Society, premature births in our work with the March of Dimes, intergenerational poverty by partnering with local non-profits that are dedicated to supporting adult learners, and we are proud to work with local organizations that are focused on supporting the needs of local youth. We help strengthen local arts organizations, senior services, and music programs with our #TeamGIVING club for non-profits. We advocate for single-parent families and second chance programs around the country. Our goal is to have a role in helping communities create the changes they want to see!
